## Algorithm behind the Game:

well the logic behind the game briefly is very simple, I have created a grid layout on a (500px X 500px) container with 20 col x 20 rows. 
And in order to move the snake, I pop the lastest tail and unshift it immediately behind his head. when the snake eats a sausage he gets bigger and his score increases, also every 5 sausages he gets faster.


## Enjoy the game.
