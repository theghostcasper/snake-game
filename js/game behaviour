1) Snake CSS is done.
2) Snake head should appear on screen.
3) When we press up arrow, snake keeps moving up.
4) when we press right arrow, snake keeps moving right, and so on.
5) if a body part intersects with the snake head, score resets to 0. and game is reset.
6) Game is reset by removing all the snake parts leaving only the head.
7) okay, now while the snake moves, his body parts move with the snake, they shouldn't intersect with the snake head on their own, neither they should be faster.
8) while the snake moves in a direction, and all his body parts are in another direction, his body parts shifts their direction like a snake movement.
9) There should be food that appears every one second that increases the snake score and allows him to grow, there should be a timer so that the snake should eat this food.
10) There should be also fragments for increasing the snake's score as he moves without increasing his body size.
11) Finally, there should be a leader board and write your name on it.
